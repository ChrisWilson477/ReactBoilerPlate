# ReactBoilerPlate

### Boiler plate React App code I built to start projects quickly Configured with Babel and Webpack

 - npm install to install the dependencies
 - open two tabs in terminal
 - In one tab run npm start (this runs live-server)
 - In the other tab run npm run build (transpiles your React code and creates an output bundle)
